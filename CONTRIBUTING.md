## Issues and Pull Requests
Before any features get implemented into the software, it must first go through a review and design process. During this time,
issues will be kept up to date with the feature request and the status of it. Anyone can support us in the review and design
process by adding to the issue or creating a draft Pull Request to be reviewed by a member of the Core Team.
